#Keto Experience - Day 1
    So I decided to try out the keto diet for myself. Seeing the progress pics on Reddit really pushed me to learn more about it. And after a long study of what consisted of eating
      right on the diet, I decided to try it out for myself. First thing I did was go on to a Keto Macro Calculator to check out how much stuff I could eat each day. On a keto diet, most of 
      your body's energy comes from fats, secondary is proteins and you really have to limit the carbs. 

      So for my body, the macro limits came out to around : 

       *Carbs - 20-30g
       *Protein - 100g
       *Fats - 110g
       *Fibre - 20-30g
      Along with this, most of the info on Reddit specifically is by Americans and even the indian subreddits like DesiKeto are mostly Indian Americans. So what about us Indians? How do we go about it?
      Luckily I live in a metro, so most of the fancy veggies which we don't usually eat like Broccoli, Asparagus, Avocados are available, but these are not really musts for a keto diet, is what I'm presuming.
      At the end of a couple of days I have ammassed these items for cooking :

       *Spinach
       *Eggs
       *Chicken Breasts
       *Nandini Paneer (Amul has less carbs so next time, I'll be buying that)
       *Virgin Cold Pressed Coconut Oil 
       *Extra Virgin Olive Oil
       *Amul Cheese Slices
       *Amul Creami Cheese Spread
       *Amul Fresh Cream
       *Amul Butter
       *Mushrooms
       *Okra
       *Carrot
       *Psyllium Husk
       *Bru Coffee

      In your keto diet, you won't be getting much fibre if you don't eat lots of veggies so Psyllium husk acts like a supplement. Another important thing to note is the concept of net carbs. 
      Net carbs are Total Carbs - Dietary Fibre. This amount must be less than 20-25g for going into ketosis. 

      Morning - Boiled Eggs + Coffee with 1 tbsp coconut Oil (~ 280 calories , 0 carbs)

      Lunch - Stir Fry (~ 700 calories, ~10g net carbs w/ 100g chicken, 70g okra, 60g spinach, 1.5 tbsp fresh cream, 2 cheese slices, half a capsicum)

      Add 1 tbsp coconut oil, ginger garlic paste, chilli powder, cumin powder to taste. 
      Fry small pieces of chicken, after a couple of minutes, add veggies and mushrooms.
      After a couple of minutes, add cheese slices and fresh cream and cook for a few minutes.

      Snack - 5 Badam (~ 40 calories, < 1 carbs)

      Dinner - TBD
